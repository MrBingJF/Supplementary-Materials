# Supplementary-Materials
These supplementary materials consists of three parts:
The part I of supplementary materials(SM-I) contains two folders, which are related to the parameters and topology of the IEEE118, 300, and 500 test systems, respectively.
The part II of supplementary materials(SM-II) involve the monthly net load scenarios generated by CGAN.
The part III of supplementary materials(SM-III) contains the detailed experimental data of the LBDSAC algorithm, which includes the structure, parameters of each neural network, the logger of  LBDSAC training process, the Tensorflow graph and the formulated unit commitment decisions.
